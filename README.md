# Project Name: NeoIDSafe
# Overview
NeoIDSafe is a blockchain-based identity verification system designed for refugees. It uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to manage identity verification across different blockchains. The system ensures that refugees can access essential services like healthcare, education, and financial assistance through verified digital credentials.

# Features
- Decentralized Identity Management: Each refugee is assigned a unique Decentralized Identifier (DID) to manage their identity securely.
- Cross-Chain Interoperability: Integration with Chainlink CCIP allows for seamless identity verification across multiple blockchain networks.
- Credential Issuance and Verification: Refugees receive verifiable credentials as NFTs or tokens, which can be used to prove their identity.
- Event Emission: The system emits events for credential issuance and cross-chain verification, ensuring transparency and traceability.

# How Chainlink is Used in the Project:
In this project, Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is used to enable cross-chain identity verification. Specifically, Chainlink CCIP ensures that identity verification can occur across different blockchains, making the credential verification system interoperable. This is done by:
- Emitting a cross-chain verification event that signals the credential needs to be verified on a specific chain (e.g., Avalanche).
- Utilizing Chainlink's oracles to send verification requests and process responses between multiple blockchains securely.

# Architecture
# Smart Contracts:
- DIDRegistry.sol: Manages the registration and retrieval of DIDs.
- VerificationOracle.sol: Handles cross-chain verification requests using Chainlink CCIP.
- CredentialNFT.sol: Issues and manages credentials as ERC721 NFTs.

# Deployment
Network: This contract is deployed on the Neo X Testnet
